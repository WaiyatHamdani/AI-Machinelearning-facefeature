## Project Description
This project is focused on **AI and Machine Learning** for detecting and analyzing facial features. The project implements a facial recognition system that extracts features from images and performs various tasks related to face analysis.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Machinelearning-facefeature.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AI-Machinelearning-facefeature
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies to get started:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    pip install pandas
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install keras
